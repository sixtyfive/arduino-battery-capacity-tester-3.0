To the best of my knowledge the original idea for the hardware, and the very first
sketch, came from Adam Welch, who had used a Nokia LCD and some protoboard for it.

## How to use?

This sketch can be used with either the Arduino IDE (just open the `.ino` file inside of the `CapacityTester` folder â€“ but you'll have to read the `#include` statements and install libraries manually) or with PlatformIO (clone this repository, then execute `pio run -t upload` with the Arduino Nano connected to the computer via USB; libraries will be downloaded and installed for you).
