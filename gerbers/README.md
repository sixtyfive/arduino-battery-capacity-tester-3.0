These are downloaded from [PCBWay](https://member.pcbway.com/Project/DownGerBerFile?filename=Arduino_Battery_Capacity_Tester_V2_0&act=downgerber) where they'd been uploaded by Debasish Dutta. They appear to be in the public domain. If ordered from JLCPCB, they come in good quality. Only be aware that there are no solder pads for the heatsink and these will have to be created by way of a knife or dremel tool; remember to also cut the copper around the pads so that the heatsink is not connected to GND, which would lead to a short and possibly exploding MOSFET. I obviously take no responsibility for your house burning down or anything bad happening. If you've never worked with high currents, consider getting the help of an experienced maker.
